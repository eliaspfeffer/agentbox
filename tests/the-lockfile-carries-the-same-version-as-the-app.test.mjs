// THE LOCKFILE CARRIES THE SAME VERSION AS THE APP.
//
// d872fdb (2026-10-05) moved package.json to 0.1.8 and left package-lock.json
// at 0.1.7. Every `npm install` in a checkout then rewrote the lockfile to
// match, which left a tracked file edited, and main/source-updater.mjs reads an
// edited tracked file as "changes of your own" and stops offering the restart.
// The founder, that evening: "I dont see the restart component in the sidebar
// that occurs when changes have made." Measured in her app folder: the only
// edit apart from the two generated files was those two version lines.
