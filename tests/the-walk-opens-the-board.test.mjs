// THE WALK OPENS THE BOARD, which is the one view it never showed.
//
// The tutorial toured the tabs, said where each thing went, and then jumped
// straight to the command palette. So the walk ended without ever opening the
// view somebody with a team opens in the morning: seeing what everyone is up
// to at once is the question the board answers and no tab does.
//
// HOW IT WAS MEASURED. The walk's own end-to-end run
// (tests/the-whole-walk-runs-end-to-end.test.mjs) stepped `where` straight to
// `command`, and no beat anywhere named the board. The nineteen-beat count in
// tests/her-three-off-the-page-of-nineteen.test.mjs is twenty now, and that
// renumbering is deliberate rather than a pin drifting.
//
// THE RULE THIS FILE HOLDS. There is a board beat; it sits after the tour and
// before the palette; it names the two presses that really reach the board,
// because the board is not a tab but a row inside the View and filters menu;
// and the beat ends when the board is actually on the screen rather than when
// either of those presses happens.
