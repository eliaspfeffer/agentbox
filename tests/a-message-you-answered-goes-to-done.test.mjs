// A MESSAGE YOU ANSWERED GOES TO DONE (w-57a202a968, 2026-10-05).
//
// A teammate sent bug findings in a message. You replied "Working on it" and
// the message disappeared from every column of the board, so an hour later it
// could not be found ("I don't see her face icon anywhere here"). The reply
// handed the conversation to the teammate (`inMyInbox`, whoever did not speak
// last), In progress never holds a message, and Done held only rows whose
// status is done, which a conversation never is. So it was on no tab at all.
//
// Her rule, in her words: "It's not supposed to leave the board; it's supposed
// to go in Done." A conversation where you spoke last is Done for you, until
// the other person writes again, when it is back in your inbox.
