// A QUESTION TYPED WHILE THE AGENT WORKED WAS READ AND NEVER ANSWERED.
//
// Reported 2026-10-06 with a photograph of the thread (w-ac7f0c0cbb). Into
// "Add to it while it works" went "I'm not sure I fully understand. Can you
// explain why you researched the website twice? Was the information lost?".
// The bubble said "Read by the agent" and the agent's next line was "Music
// chosen: a driving electronic track...". It was asked again, "didn't hear back
// from this", also marked read, and again the run carried on. Progress lines
// kept arriving the whole time, so nothing was broken: the message was
// delivered and the agent simply did not treat it as something to answer.
//
// Why it would not. A reply to a session that has FINISHED is wrapped by
// `replyBrief` ("Do what it asks first, before you go back to anything you were
// doing"). A reply steered into a session that is STILL RUNNING was handed over
// as bare words with no framing at all, while the brief that session is holding
// says its last message is the result and "there is no other way to report and
// no second chance at it". Read together that is an instruction to note the
// words and keep working.
//
// So the fix is the missing half of that pair: `liveReplyBrief`, around their
// words only when they are reaching a session that is genuinely mid-turn.
