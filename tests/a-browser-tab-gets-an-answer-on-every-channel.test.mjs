// EVERY CHANNEL THE SCREEN ASKS FOR HAS AN ANSWER IN A BROWSER TAB.
//
// What broke: `npx agentbox-app` opened a tab that hammered the server with
// about five thousand failing requests a second. Four channels in
// shared/bridge-map.mjs (badge, bootInfo, notify, crash) were only ever
// registered by main/main.mjs, inside the desktop window, so the browser server
// answered each with 404. The screen turned the failed `badge` into an uncaught
// error, reported it on `crash`, which also failed, which was reported on
// `crash` again: 33,385 requests in six seconds, measured on 2026-10-07 by
// installing the packed tarball into an empty folder and loading the tab in a
// headless Chrome.
//
// The test that would have caught it compares the phone book with what the
// browser server actually answers, so a channel added to the desktop alone
// fails here rather than in somebody's tab.
