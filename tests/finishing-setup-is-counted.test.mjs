// FINISHING SETUP IS COUNTED, AND ONLY FINISHING IT.
//
// `first_run_finished` has been on the approved list and the privacy page since
// 2026-08-19, and nothing ever sent it. Measured 2026-10-06 in PostHog: zero
// events of that name from 33 installs, while `app_opened` had 285. On the day
// downloads opened, about ten new people installed the app and there was no way
// to say how many of them got through setup.
//
// The cases:
//   · walking it to the end counts (the finish card and the import card);
//   · the quiet way out does NOT count, because skipping is not finishing;
//   · the tutorial somebody re-runs from ⌘K weeks later does NOT count, because
//     it is not their first run and it would count the same person twice;
//   · the app really sends it from the walk's one finishing function, by name.
