// WHAT THE RENDERER'S TYPES MUST STILL REFUSE.
//
// tests/the-renderer-typechecks-clean.test.mjs compiles this file on the
// renderer's own settings and checks that every marked line is STILL an error,
// with the code written beside it. Nothing here is ever imported or run.
//
// Why it exists: all 19 of the errors this guards could have been silenced with
// an `any` or a cast, and both of those pass a clean typecheck while telling
// the next reader nothing. A clean typecheck alone cannot tell the two apart;
// this file can, because an `any` would make these lines compile.
//
// No tsconfig includes this file but the test's own, so its errors never reach
// the renderer's typecheck.

// where a number goes is refused rather than waved through, which is the thing
// a missing declaration file stops happening.

// AND THE EVENT UNION IS STILL A UNION. An event is either a message or a
// thing the agent ran, so reading a message's words off one that has not been
// narrowed must stay an error: that is exactly what the 11 item-thread errors
// were, and widening `AgentEvent` would have made them go away while leaving
// the screen free to draw `undefined` as somebody's reply.
