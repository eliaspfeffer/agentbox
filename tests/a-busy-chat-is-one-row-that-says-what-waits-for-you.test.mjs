// A BUSY CHAT IS ONE ROW, AND THE ROW SAYS WHAT IS WAITING FOR YOU.
//
// Asked on 2026-10-05 (w-920461cbe6), the day threads shipped: "what happens in
// the event where a chat is very active? Let's say you're in a chat, and three
// people reply to your thread, and some other people respond in the chat
// itself. What ends up in your inbox? We don't want to overcrowd the user...
// it's easy to miss threads. You also don't want a bunch of messages for one
// concept." Then, approving the advice: "as the chat evolves the ticket you see
// should evolve (and the preview in the board/inbox). build it".
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG, measured on the rule as it stood (`lastSpeaker`, the newest
// answer on the row, whoever wrote it, wherever):
//   - a reply in a thread you are not in pulled the whole chat into your inbox;
//   - your own reply in the main chat took the chat OUT of your inbox while
//     three people were still waiting on you in your thread;
//   - the row read only the newest line, so a thread reply hid behind the chat
//     or the chat behind a thread reply.
//
// THE RULE NOW, all of it read off who spoke where, with nothing new stored:
//   1. still one row per chat;
//   2. a thread counts only for the people in it (who wrote the message it
//      hangs off, and who replied);
//   3. the chat waits on you while someone else spoke last in the main chat, or
//      in any thread you are in;
//   4. the row and the board card say what is waiting, in words, and change as
//      the chat does;
//   5. opening the chat marks the threads with replies to you, and when one
//      thread is the only news it opens by itself.
