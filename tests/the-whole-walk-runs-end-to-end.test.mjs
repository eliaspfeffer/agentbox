// THE WALK FROM THE FIRST SCREEN TO THE LAST, IN ONE RUN.
//
// Everything already written about the walk tests one beat at a time: this dot
// is lit, that ring lands here, this sentence says that. What none of them does
// is walk it, and a walk is exactly the thing that breaks when a beat is added
// or moved, because each beat still passes its own test while the chain between
// them is cut. The Step union has been rewritten five times in three days.
//
// So this file drives the real state machine from START to `landed` with the
// real events, in her order, and asserts the whole shape of the run rather than
// any one frame of it:
//
//   - every beat is reached, in the order the dots count them
//   - the walk never goes backwards and never lights the same dot twice going
//     forward, apart from beat six, which is one task leaving and coming back
//   - what was chosen on an early screen is still there at the end
//   - the list under the walk holds what that beat is about, and nothing else
//   - an event arriving at the wrong moment is refused rather than obeyed
//
// If a beat is added, this file fails until the run is written through it. That
// is the point: a new beat nobody can reach is the failure that costs a person
// their first two minutes with the app, and it has no other symptom.
