// A NEW ACCOUNT SHOWS UP WHEN ITS SIGN IN FINISHES.
//
// What broke, 2026-10-05: Settings says "the account appears above when it is
// done", and it did not. `claude auth login` printed "Login successful." and
// went back to the prompt, and the new row kept reading "Not signed in" until
// something unrelated happened to reload the page ("i clicked some things
// around and eventually my account did show up"). The account list was read
// once when Add was pressed and never again, because nothing was listening for
// the sign in to end.
//
// The terminal already knows: its foreground process is `claude` while the
// sign in runs and the shell again once it returns. So the page reloads on that
// change, once per command that finishes, and not on the shell merely sitting
// at its prompt before anything has run.
