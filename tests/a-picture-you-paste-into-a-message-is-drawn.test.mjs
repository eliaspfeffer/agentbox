// A PICTURE YOU PASTE INTO A MESSAGE IS DRAWN, NOT SPELLED OUT.
//
// On 2026-10-05 a screenshot pasted into a reply showed up in the thread as
// its own markdown: the line
//   ![pasted-69703.png](attachments/muw39o3w-vitsyq-pasted-69703.png)
// in plain text where the picture should be. The agent still got the file; only
// the drawing was wrong. It had worked before, and it broke the same afternoon
// (7eba493), when a person's message stopped going through markdown so that a
// pasted `grep ... --include=*.md` kept its stars. That fix was right, but the
// app itself writes every picture you attach into the message as markdown
// (renderer/src/attachments.ts), so it took the pictures with it.
//
// Measured before this fix by rendering Thread with that one message: the body
// was the raw text, `<img` appeared nowhere in it.
//
// The rule now: a person's words are still drawn as typed, but a line the app
// wrote for an attachment, a picture or a file standing on its own line, is
// drawn as the picture or the link it is.
