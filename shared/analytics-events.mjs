// Her eight, approved 2026-08-19 under her 08-18 rule: NO CODE, PROMPTS, KEYS
// OR PATHS. Seven of them are counts and the eighth is the version pair, which
// is not an event but a property on every one of them, exactly as
// `legal/privacy.html` section 5.1 describes it.
//
// This file is SHARED so the code and the published promise cannot drift apart.
// The privacy page lists these sentences; a test reads them from here and fails
// the build when one of them is missing from the page, and
// `scripts/shot-legal-pages.mjs` in the store fails from the other side.
//
// The naming rule that matters: an event name says THAT something happened. It
// never carries what it happened to. There is no room in this file for a title,
// a path, a repo name or a slug, and the property allowlist below is what stops
// a future caller adding one by accident.

// name -> the sentence the privacy page promises, word for word.
