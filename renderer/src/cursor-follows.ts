// THE KEYBOARD'S PLACE FOLLOWS ITS THREAD, NOT ITS NUMBER.
//
// `selected` is a place in the list (or the board's reading order). When the
// list changes under a cursor nobody moved, a thread leaving above it or an
// agent carrying it to another column, place 21 names a different card, and
// the board scrolls to that card. With a busy fleet that was every few
// seconds, wherever you had scrolled to (2026-10-05,
// tests/a-refresh-keeps-the-keyboard-on-the-same-thread.test.mjs).
//
// So: if the place is the one we last drew, the cursor is on the thread we
// last drew, wherever it now sits. If the place changed, you moved it, and
// your move wins.
