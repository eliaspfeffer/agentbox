// PURE. Old finished threads, loaded a page at a time, folded into the rows.
//
// w-fda2165ec6. The snapshot reads a ledger's last 8 MB, so a long one's
// oldest finished threads are missing from it and a few more are half there
// (their first lines cut, so a blank title). The foot of Done and All asks
// main for them a page at a time (`listOlderItems`, main/store.mjs), and this
// is where a page meets the snapshot. The snapshot is the live copy and wins,
// except over a half-cut thread, which the page has whole: same id, a
// different `createdAt`, and nothing written to it since the page was read.
// `tests/the-all-tab-holds-finished-threads-too.test.mjs`.
