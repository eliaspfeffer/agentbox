// PURE. THREADS IN A CHAT WITH TEAMMATES (w-920461cbe6), "like in Slack".
//
// A reply in a thread is an ordinary message line that also names the message
// it answers (`inReplyTo`, that message's line uid). This file decides three
// things about them and nothing else: which messages leave the chat for a
// thread, what the one line under a message with replies says, and how wide
// the panel beside the chat may be dragged. Drawn by ../components/Thread.tsx
// and ./ThreadPanel.tsx, pinned by tests/a-reply-in-a-thread-sits-beside-the-chat.
//
// The pick, in the person's words: "Yeah, definitely agree with the panel
// beside the chat. I think in Slack you can resize this so we might want to
// allow resizing."
