// A PERSON'S MESSAGE, SPLIT INTO WHAT THEY TYPED AND WHAT THE APP ATTACHED.
//
// A person's words are drawn as typed, never through markdown (Thread.tsx,
// w-a33b339772). But the app itself writes every picture or file attached to a
// message into the text as markdown, one per line (attachments.ts:
// `![name](attachments/…)` or `[name](attachments/…)`). Drawn as typed, a pasted
// screenshot showed up as that line of brackets instead of the picture
// (2026-10-05, tests/a-picture-you-paste-into-a-message-is-drawn.test.mjs).
//
// So those lines, and only those, are lifted out to be drawn as markdown:
//   a picture, `![…](…)`, standing alone on its line;
//   a file link, `[…](attachments/…)`, standing alone on its line.
// The syntax quoted inside a sentence is words, and so is a link a person typed
// to anywhere else: the app never writes either.
